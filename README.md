# Unsupervised-learning
The goal in this project is to analyze and interpret an unsupervised learning problem based on survey data. This will require an ability to code unsupervised machine learning algorithms and interpret their results. There are millions of mobile apps. In this assignment, the task consist in analyzing app download behavior as well as other information related to consumers. 
The goal is to segment users based on unsupervised machine learning techniques.
